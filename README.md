# REXUS Kernel

A specialized kernel designed for firmware engineers, DIY OS developers, and hardware engineers working on complex embedded projects.

## Overview
REXUS is a high-performance, lightweight kernel optimized for embedded systems with direct hardware control capabilities. It's built with a hybrid approach using C for low-level components and C++ for higher-level abstractions.

## Features
- Minimalist design with focus on performance and direct hardware access
- Modular architecture allowing selective component inclusion
- Hardware abstraction layer for portability across different platforms
- Real-time scheduling capabilities
- Lightweight memory management

## Building
See the `docs/building.md` file for detailed build instructions.
